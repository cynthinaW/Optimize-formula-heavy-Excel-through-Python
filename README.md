We have a file in excel, it's formular heavy. This file reports the information about our inventory and shipments, a lot of columns that tell us if the shipment needs to be split (no warehouse has inventory for SKUs in shipment) or can be sent to another warehouse or is oversold, etc.  there is other good information, like work type, ship method, delivery date.This excel utilize very requently,but the formulas make them hard to open on a lot of PCs so I would like to use python script to run the functions instead of these formular, and I grab the final results in a short time.
